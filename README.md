### 1.1 Project goals

**Player goals**

Audience: 

The primary target audience for players of this game is *10-15 year old children studying middle school level mathematics*. The secondary target audience is younger children for extension material or older children/adults for learning support material. 

Goals:

* Practice and test the mathematical concepts of substitution and order of operations.
* Practice and test the mathematical concepts of arithmetic operations, negative numbers and basic indices.
* Have fun testing their knowledge and competing against an opponent. 
* Improve confidence and fluency with numeracy and algebra skills.
* Have a positive and useful educational experience.

How project satisfies these player goals:

* Game is designed to be adversarial to encourage focus and to motivate players.
* Provides useful feedback to players about whether they have evaluated an expression correctly.
* Feedback is provided to players after each about whether they chose the optimal expression from the grid so that they can understand and improve their performance in the game over time.
* Complexity of algebric expressions is aligned with UK GCSE curriculum for expected level of proficiency of pupils aged 10-15 years.
* Mathematical notation used is clear, unambiguous and appropriate to experience of target audience players.
* Expressions vary each time the game is played to provide value to players for a longer period of time.
* UI of game board and controls is intuitive for new players to use.
* Styling and design is planned to be engaging and attractive to players of target audience.
* User feedback is clear, immediate and intuitive so players learn quickly and intuitively how the game works.

**Teacher goals**

Audience:

The target audience for teachers using this game is *teachers/tutors of any school/national mathematics curriculum.*

Goals:

* To engage and motivate their students to practice and improve.
* Test students' knowledge and understanding by measuring their performance.
* Provide students with instant, automated feedback for their learning.
* To supply students with a less routine, more game based practice of mathematics. 
* To provide students with an activity that is educationally relevant and which has clear learning development value.
* An activity that facilitates differentiation for students of varying abilities in mathematics. 
* An activity that is easy to learn and undertstand how to engage with without much teacher instruction/intervention.


How project satisfies these teacher goals:

* The game has a head-to-head competitive format to engage learners.
* Keeps track of performance of players in the game by measuring rate at which they chose the optimum expression and players are informed of their performance rating after each selection. 
* The visual design of the game is vibrant, fun, engaging and stimulating to learners with bold colors and simple user feedback.
* The game randomizes the selection of expressions so it is useful as a learning exercise multiple times and improvement can be seen over attempts made.
* There are difficulty options available to the user to provide a selection of more/less complex expressions to players of different ability levels. 
* The instructions and guidance for how to play the game is clearly displayed to the user and available at all times. 
* The user is clearly and gracefully informed if they perform an incorrect or disallowed action or input.

**Developer and site owner goals**

* As a secondary maths teacher - to create a useful and engaging learning activity to help mathematics students in my classes and in my school community. 
* To practice and deepen my understanding of how to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS by creating an interactive, user-friendly web appliations.
* To begin the journey of creating interactive educational applications as I seek to change to a career in this sector. 
* To create a project that can be part of an interesting and commercially viable developer porfolio to help me find a job.
* To learn more about and practice the paradigm of test-driven development (TDD) with JavaScript and the Jasmine test suite. 
* To improve my ability to design and create useful educational experiences with technology through the process of planning, implementing and testing this application and crucially, obtaining feedback from other teaching proffessionals.

### 1.3 Wireframes and design choices

[Link to wireframes](url)

**Design choices**

* Tablet/desktop first design strategy was followed since the main purpose of the application is as a classroom based learning tool where users would most likely bne using a tablet/laptop/desktop device size. Also, since it is a two player game on one device there experience is more suited to a larger display size where players can see the game board more clearly at all times.
